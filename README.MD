# Snake for Sega Genesis

Hello there! This is just another classical game clone. I made it some time ago, when I found a C compiler for Sega Genesis (SGDK). If you like retro-programming you should give it a look!

The compiled ROM of the game is "/out/rom.bin". You can open it with any Sega emulator.
